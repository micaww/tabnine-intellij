# TabNine IntelliJ Platform Plugin

This is a very early, unofficial, work-in-progress implementation of TabNine integration for all IntelliJ products.

It is in a slightly working state. Autocomplete currently works ~70% of the time.

#### Binaries

The latest TabNine binary for your system architecture and OS must have this path:
```
/usr/local/tabnine/2.0.2/TabNine
```
